I am a digital strategist in New York, partnering with brands, advocacy groups, and non-profits to inspire people to take action for good causes. I'm currently working independently on small projects building digital teams for cause-based organizations.

I previously served as Senior Vice President at Blue State Digital (WPP Group), an agency and technology company that works with non-profits, advocacy organizations, and brands to build campaigns for social good. I led major partnerships in New York, San Francisco, and London with Google, Google Fiber, the Obama Foundation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the NAACP, among others. After several years in DC, I co-founded the agencyâ€™s San Francisco office before moving to NYC.

Prior to joining BSD, I led digital advocacy at a prominent lobbying and public affairs firm in Washington. I worked with large corporations, universities and trade associations to mobilize supporters on behalf of important legislation and policies. I've also spent time in the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Department of Justice, Xerox Corporation, and several political campaigns.

I live in Brooklyn, occassionally compete in triathlons, and take a lot of photos. I'm a graduate of the London School of Economics, and American University.
