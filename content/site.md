This website has been around in various forms since 2002. It is more of a sandbox for testing and experimentation than a soapbox to stand on. Opinions are mine, and usually half-formed. They do not represent the opinions of my employer(s) or clients.

Static files are generated by Jekyll and deployed to Netlify. The theme was ported by Nick Balestra from a theme for Cactus.
