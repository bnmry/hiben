This website has been around in various forms since 2002. It is more of a sandbox for testing and experimentation than a soapbox to stand on. Opinions are mine, and usually half-formed. They do not represent the opinions of my employer(s) or clients.

It is built on the Kube framework, utilizes the static site generator Hugo, and is deployed to Netlify.
